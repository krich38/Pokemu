# Pokemu
Pokemon Metallic Silver game engine. Programmed in Java utilizing JavaFX

Project completed 21/02/2015

The engine is completely finished.

In terms of a pokemon game, it is about 80% finished. It still needs all NPC's added, along with other things such as player money, etc. I just ran out of time when adding in the final parts of the pokemon version. The initial project was only ever a game engine anyway.
